# Real Estate App using MERN Stack

## Project Overview
The Real Estate App is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that allows users to browse, search, and filter real estate listings. It includes features for users to view property details, manage their favorite properties, and contact property agents.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB, Prisma for Schema
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Styling**: CSS

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login system with JWT-based authentication.
- **Property Listings**: Browse and search for real estate properties.
- **Property Details**: View detailed information about properties including images and descriptions.
- **Favorites**: Save and manage favorite properties.
- **Contact Agents**: Send inquiries directly to property agents.

## Authentication
Authentication is handled using JWT. Upon successful login, a JWT token is stored in a cookie. This token is used to authenticate requests to protected routes.

## State Management
The Context API is used for managing global state in the React application. It provides a way to share state across components without passing props manually at every level.
